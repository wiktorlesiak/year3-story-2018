<h1>Chapter03 for Assessment Component: Git Story </h1>

There was a flicker of light in the darkness. Eskel wasn’t sure whether it was the darkness of his 
head or whether it was night. When had night fallen anyway? But there definitely was a flicker 
of light. To move towards it or not, that was the question. The decision was made for him, as 
the horse beneath his aching body calmly trudged in that direction. Right. It wasn’t just in 
his head, then, if Mantis could see it too. Probably a camp-fire But whose?

<p>
Burning pain laced along his leg and he groaned. A low voice muttered something unintelligible.
Was it himself? He attempted to move, but then his arm protested even worse. Oh right, broken.
He’d forgotten. Mantis’ huffing seemed loud in the stillness surrounding them. Then he felt 
himself begin to slide off the horse’s back. No, no, not good, he was trying to get to… where
was he going again? He struggled to stay on, but the pain was overwhelming his senses again. 
There was the low murmuring voice again. This time he could make out the words ”ploughing shit”
among a longer string of muttered profanities that he couldn’t keep track of. Probably his own
voice, after all. He agreed whole-heartedly at least. He did feel like swearing profusely at 
his rotten luck. Then he slipped all the way off the horse’s back, and his mind went white with 
pain once more.

He was lying on the ground again. Shit. Where was Mantis? There was no tugging on his hair this
time. His left arm hurt. Badly. There was pressure on the joints – elbow and shoulder both –
and then something twisted, and he writhed in response. A weight settled on his chest. He had
trouble breathing. And then his arm was yanked once more, making his thoughts an incoherent 
jumble of rage and pain. He wasn’t entirely sure, whether the roar he felt in his mind was 
just an intention or if he actually managed to voice it. Sweet, comfortable darkness engulfed 
him again.
