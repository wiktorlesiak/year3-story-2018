 It had been a mild winter that year with temperatures hovering just around the point of freezing,and 
 because of it he hadn’t been back to Kaer Morhen. There was plenty to do, too. Apparently monsters made 
 use of the less harsh conditions just like everyone else. He hadn’t thought much of it when some villagers
 requested he get rid of the wyverns that kept making off with their livestock. Wyverns, plural. That should 
 have made him more concerned than it did. They had pooled everything they had to be able to pay him something 
 up front, but the amount had been a pittance and he had found himself taking a leaf out of Geralt’s book, Pity
 for the Poor, and telling them he’d do it for free. They had been very grateful, and he had eaten very well 
 that evening, and they restocked his supplies with good stuff. Plenty of oats for his horse as well.
