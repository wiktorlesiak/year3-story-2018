 It had been a mild winter that year with temperatures hovering just around the point of freezing,and 
 because of it he hadn’t been back to Kaer Morhen. There was plenty to do, too. Apparently monsters made 
 use of the less harsh conditions just like everyone else. He hadn’t thought much of it when some villagers
 requested he get rid of the wyverns that kept making off with their livestock. Wyverns, plural. That should 
 have made him more concerned than it did. They had pooled everything they had to be able to pay him something 
 up front, but the amount had been a pittance and he had found himself taking a leaf out of Geralt’s book, Pity
 for the Poor, and telling them he’d do it for free. They had been very grateful, and he had eaten very well 
 that evening, and they restocked his supplies with good stuff. Plenty of oats for his horse as well.

 Tracking flying beasts is a lot easier said than done, so it was more of an aimless trip through the landscape,
 while hoping he might find remains of their prey. He did. Frequently. It brought him from the foothills and higher 
 into the mountains. Of course creatures like those would be nesting on an eyrie somewhere. Took him several days
 before he caught sight of a live wyvern. At least then he’d known he was on the right track.

That job had taken much longer than he’d expected and it had brought him much further into the mountains than he’d 
planned for. With a little cunning he had been able to single the beasts out one at a time, so he didn’t have to 
take on all five together. Thank whatever gods had planned for stupid creatures like that. Made some things so much
easier. When the last of them lay dead on the rocky out-cropping the fight had taken them to he was about ready to
congratulate himself when Mantis whinneyed in alarm. He ran to the horse’s aid, and not a moment too soon either. A
royal wyvern had his steed backed onto a ledge that really was no place for a horse.
