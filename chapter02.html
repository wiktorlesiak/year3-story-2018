He wasn’t quite sure how he did it, but his right arm at least seemed moderately fine, and with a solid grip on Mantis’ 
reigns, he got the horse to drag him out from under the carcass. The exhaustion threatened to overwhelm him again. His 
right side and thigh were torn to shreds. Probably where the stinger had gotten him during the fall. Shit. Shit. Shit. 
He’d begun to wish he’d just died in the fall, and he seriously started considering just grabbing a bottle of booze 
from his pack and drink himself to oblivion, while waiting for the blood loss and poison to kill him. Even if it didn’t,
there was no way he’d be able to find food and water in this condition. He’d starve to death before he’d be able to move
around again. He cursed his rotten luck in as many colourful ways he could think of. The sound of his own voice hurt 
his ears and head. Of course. A concussion. If he hadn’t hit his head on the way down that would’ve been a miracle.
