<h1>Chapter03 for Assessment Component: Git Story </h1>

<p>
There was a flicker of light in the darkness. Eskel wasn’t sure whether it was the darkness of his 
head or whether it was night. When had night fallen anyway? But there definitely was a flicker 
of light. To move towards it or not, that was the question. The decision was made for him, as 
the horse beneath his aching body calmly trudged in that direction. Right. It wasn’t just in 
his head, then, if Mantis could see it too. Probably a camp-fire But whose?
</p>

<p>
Burning pain laced along his leg and he groaned. A low voice muttered something unintelligible.
Was it himself? He attempted to move, but then his arm protested even worse. Oh right, broken.
He’d forgotten. Mantis’ huffing seemed loud in the stillness surrounding them. Then he felt 
himself begin to slide off the horse’s back. No, no, not good, he was trying to get to… where
was he going again? He struggled to stay on, but the pain was overwhelming his senses again. 
There was the low murmuring voice again. This time he could make out the words ”ploughing shit”
among a longer string of muttered profanities that he couldn’t keep track of. Probably his own
voice, after all. He agreed whole-heartedly at least. He did feel like swearing profusely at 
his rotten luck. Then he slipped all the way off the horse’s back, and his mind went white with 
pain once more.
</p>

<p>
He was lying on the ground again. Shit. Where was Mantis? There was no tugging on his hair this
time. His left arm hurt. Badly. There was pressure on the joints – elbow and shoulder both –
and then something twisted, and he writhed in response. A weight settled on his chest. He had
trouble breathing. And then his arm was yanked once more, making his thoughts an incoherent 
jumble of rage and pain. He wasn’t entirely sure, whether the roar he felt in his mind was 
just an intention or if he actually managed to voice it. Sweet, comfortable darkness engulfed 
him again.
</p>

<p>
His side hurt. Pain seared through him. Why did it feel worse now? Wasn’t pain supposed to dull
the closer you got to death? Eskel tried to gather his thoughts. Tendrils of darkness wafted
through his mind, and he considered just relaxing into them. At least it might stop the pain
A different, stinging pain on his cheek brought him away from that idea. What? F**k it. He 
didn’t care anymore. He ignored it.
</p>

<p>
Three more slaps – for that’s what they were – followed in rapid succession, bringing his 
consciousness to the forefront again. “Don’t you fucking dare die on me now, witcher!”
Well, that definitely wasn’t him talking. “Stay awake!”

He attempted to open his eyes, but found he couldn’t. He grunted in frustration. He wasn’t 
lying flat on his back anymore. His torso was raised from the ground at an angle leaning 
against something. He couldn’t quite tell what. Pain lanced through his side again, and a
gasp escaped him.

“I know, I know. Sorry. Gotta get all the poison out before I patch you up.” He focused on the 
quiet, muttered words that seemed to come from so far away. There was something about the 
low tones that seemed… oh. Wait, what? A woman? In the middle of nowhere? He gathered all 
his remaining strength and managed to pry his eyes open. Just a crack. She was kneeling next
to him, working quickly with a wash cloth and a bottle he couldn’t see very well. Her long,
dark hair was messy and dirty and obscured most of her face, he could only just see her profile
as it was illuminated by the firelight. Fire. Camp-fire. So there had been a camp-fire And he
was lying next to it. How did he get here? And why wasn’t it warm? He was stark naked. He should
be able to feel the heat on his skin. Wait – naked? How? When?

Another brush with the wash cloth burned the current thoughts from his mind, and when he gathered 
them again the woman was busy putting stitches in his side. He hadn’t been around for the first
many sets of them that much was clear. She noticed he was awake again.
